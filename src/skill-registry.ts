/**
 * SkillRegistry: mirrors Pi's native skill discovery result as a
 * name → final SKILL.md mapping.
 *
 * Implemented on top of the Pi SDK's DefaultResourceLoader pointed at the
 * real agent dir and cwd, so discovery rules and same-name priority stay
 * Pi's own — this module never re-implements directory scanning.
 *
 * Extensions are NOT loaded during discovery (`noExtensions`): extension code
 * must never execute as a side effect of resolving a profile. Skills that
 * extensions contribute at runtime are therefore absent here — they load with
 * their extension instead of being referenced by profiles.
 *
 * Discovery re-runs on every call, so newly added/removed skills are
 * reflected immediately (glob references re-expand at every start).
