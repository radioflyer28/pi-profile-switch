/**
 * InstanceCleanup: sweeps stale per-launch instance directories at startup.
 *
 * Every launch materializes its own instance dir under
 * `<PI_PROFILE_SWITCH_DIR>/instances/launch-*` (ADR-0010), which would
 * otherwise accumulate forever. Startup sweep is the ONLY cleanup mechanism by
 * design: any exit — graceful, signal, SIGKILL, power loss — kills the child
 * pid, so the next launch's sweep converges. There is no exit-time deletion; it
 * would only buy immediacy at the cost of deletion logic on the signal path.
 *
 * Liveness token: a `pid` file written by spawnPi into the instance dir.
 * (Naming the dir after the pid is impossible — the pid does not exist before
 * spawn, and the running process's PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR path is frozen.) Rules
 * per instance dir:
 * - pid file parses and the process is alive (or EPERM) → keep;
 *   ESRCH → candidate.
 * - no/unparsable pid file → candidate only when the dir mtime is older than
 *   NO_PID_GRACE_MS. The grace window guards the concurrent-launch race (a
 *   second launcher between mkdir and its pid write must not be reaped); it
 *   also covers post-mkdir crashes.
 * PID reuse needs no /proc check: a wrong keep only delays cleanup and
 * self-heals once the reused pid dies.
 *
 * A candidate is reclaimed only when every entry in it is pi-profile's own
 * or has been dispositioned away. Unrecognized entries (state an extension
 * created at runtime) get one of three dispositions per entry (ADR-0012):
 * content that references the instance dir's own path, exceeds the scan
 * budget, or is not a regular file/dir is kept and reported; position-
 * independent content is renamed into the real agent dir (adopted), or
 * deleted when the real agent dir already holds that name (real wins — the
 * conflict window means the instance copy is never the authority). The sweep
 * never destroys data it cannot attribute.
 *
 * Everything is best-effort: sweep errors never block a launch.
